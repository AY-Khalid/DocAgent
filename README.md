**DocAgent** is a lightweight AI-powered clinical assistant I built using Streamlit and LangChain. It allows healthcare professionals and researchers to query common medical conditions and receive intelligent, contextually relevant responses based on a curated corpus of 30 common ailments.

This project was created and maintained by **Anidu Yakubu Khalid** as a practical tool for medical support, documentation reference, and exploration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in clinical AI.  



## Features

- **Question Answering**: Ask natural-language clinical questions and get concise, evidence-based answers.  
- **RAG Engine**: Utilizes LangChain + FAISS + HuggingFace Embeddings for fast and accurate document retrieval.  
- **Powered by OpenAI GPT**: Uses `gpt-4o-mini` or similar model via the OpenAI API.  
- **Custom Medical Corpus**: Includes more than 20 .txt documents covering diseases like diabetes, hypertension, HIV/AIDS, COVID-19, malaria, and more, scraped from WHO official website "https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets".  
-  **Streamlit UI**: Intuitive web interface for live interaction.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docAgent.git  
cd docAgent  
````

### 2. Create a `.env` File  

Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and paste your OpenAI API key like this:  

```env  
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  
```

> **Keep this file secret!** Never share your API key publicly.  

### 3. Install Dependencies  

```bash   
pip install -r requirements.txt  
```

### 4. Run the App  

```bash  
streamlit run app.py  
```

## Files to Ignore on Deployment  

Make sure these are in your `.gitignore`:  

```gitignore  
.env  
vectorstore/  
__pycache__/  
*.pyc  
gpt_api_key.docx  
```
